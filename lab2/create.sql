-- For Lab2, our Solution for Lab1 is the base file that you'll have to modify

--DROP SCHEMA CASCADE and CREATE SCHEMA statements can appear, but aren't required

DROP SCHEMA Lab2 CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA Lab2;

-- Create tables

-- Shoppers(shopperID, shopperName, address, joinDate, status)
CREATE TABLE Shoppers (
	shopperID INTEGER, 
	shopperName VARCHAR(40), 
	address VARCHAR(60), 
	joinDate DATE,
    status CHAR(1),
	PRIMARY KEY (shopperID),
	CONSTRAINT a_shopper UNIQUE (shopperName, address)
);
-- shopperID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY is also correct

-- Products(productID, productName, manufacturer, regularPrice)
CREATE TABLE Products (
	productID INTEGER, 
	productName VARCHAR(40), 
	manufacturer VARCHAR(40),
    regularPrice NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (productID),
	CONSTRAINT a_product UNIQUE (productName, manufacturer)
);
--productID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY is also correct 
-- regularPrice DECIMAL(5,2) is also correct
 
-- Markets(marketID, address, managerID, numCheckStands)
CREATE TABLE Markets (
	marketID INTEGER,
	address VARCHAR(60) UNIQUE,

	stillEmployed BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (empID),
	FOREIGN KEY (marketID) REFERENCES Markets

-- empID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY is also correct
-- FOREIGN KEY (marketID) REFERENCES Markets (marketID) is also correct

-- ShoppingTrips(shopperID, tripTimestamp, marketID, empID, payType, paymentValid)
CREATE TABLE ShoppingTrips (
	shopperID INTEGER,

-- FOREIGN KEY (shopperID) REFERENCES Shoppers(shopperID) is also correct
-- FOREIGN KEY (marketID) REFERENCES Markets (marketID) is also correct
-- FOREIGN KEY (checkerID) REFERENCES Employees (checkerID) is also correct    

-- Purchases(shopperID,  tripTimeStamp, productID, quantity, paidPrice)
CREATE TABLE Purchases (
